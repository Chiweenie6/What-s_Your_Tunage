## Description
An application created using MERN stack. The application has a React front end , an Express.js and Node.js server and a MongoDB database to hold album and user information. The application is built with GraphQL API along with an Apollo Server. GraphQL queries and mutations allow the user to view information on the albums as well as leave reviews. The user can save albums to their profile to view once more without having to find them again.
